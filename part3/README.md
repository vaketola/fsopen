The course notes say to use a separate repository to make deployment easier.
However, Render has an option to specify the root directory of the deployed code.
For this reason, the code is all contained in this repository in the same format as other exercises.

The old other repo with commits for exercises 3.1-3.9 is still available at:

https://github.com/vaketola/fsopen-exercise3

From Render: "Your free instance will spin down with inactivity, which can delay requests by 50 seconds or more."
